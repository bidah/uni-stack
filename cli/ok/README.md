## Usage

Generate a new project by running:

```sh
npx rn-ai
```

Next, either configure your environment variables with the CLI, or do so later.

### Running the app

Change into the app directory and run:

```sh
npm start
```

### Running the server

Change into the server directory and run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Theming

To add a new theme, open `app/src/theme.ts` and add a new theme with the following configuration:

```ts
const christmas = {
  // extend an existing theme or start from scratch
  ...lightTheme,
  name: 'Christmas',
  label: 'christmas',
  tintColor: '#ff0000',
  textColor: '#378b29',
  tabBarActiveTintColor: '#378b29',
  tabBarInactiveTintColor: '#ff0000',
  placeholderTextColor: '#378b29',
}
```

At the bottom of the file, export the new theme:

```ts
export {
  lightTheme, darkTheme, hackerNews, miami, vercel, christmas
}
```

## Configuring LLM Models

Here is how to add new or remove existing LLM models.

### In the app

You can add or configure a model by updating `MODELS` in `constants.ts`.

For removing models, just remove the models you do not want to support.

For adding models, once the model definition is added to the `MODELS` array, you should update `src/screens/chat.tsx` to support the new model:

1. Create local state to hold new model data
2. Update `chat()` function to handle new model type
3. Create `generateModelReponse` function to call new model
4. Update `getChatType` in `utils.ts` to configure the LLM type that will correspond with your server path.
5. Render new model in UI

```tsx
{
  chatType.label.includes('newModel') && (
    <FlatList
      data={newModelReponse.messages}
      renderItem={renderItem}
      scrollEnabled={false}
    />
  )
}
```

### On the server

Create a new file in the `server/src/chat` folder that corresponds to the model type you created in the mobile app. You can probably copy and re-use a lot of the streaming code from the other existing paths to get you started.

Next, update `server/src/chat/chatRouter` to use the new route.

## Configuring Image Models

Here is how to add new or remove existing Image models.

### In the app

You can add or configure a model by updating `IMAGE_MODELS` in `constants.ts`.

For removing models, just remove the models you do not want to support.

For adding models, once the model definition is add to the `IMAGE_MODELS` array, you should update `src/screens/images.tsx` to support the new model.

Main consideration is input. Does the model take text, image, or both as inputs?

The app is configured to handle both, but you must update the `generate` function to pass the values to the API accordingly.

### On the server

#### Fal.ai

In `server/src/images/fal`, update the handler function to take into account the new model.

#### Other API providers

Create a new file in `server/src/images/modelName`, update the handler function to handle the new API call.

Next, update `server/src/images/imagesRouter` to use the new route.
